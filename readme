# DSA-Demos (Sorting + Stack & Queue Visualizer)

This folder contains two small, presentation-friendly C++ programs demonstrating basic algorithms and data structures.

Files:
- `sorting_demo.cpp` — Sorting demo (Bubble, Selection, Insertion, QuickSort). Interactive, counts comparisons/swaps and measures time. Good for live step-by-step runs.
- `ds_visualizer.cpp` — Stack & Queue visualizer. Array-based and linked-list implementations, prints internal state after each operation. Good for demonstrating LIFO vs FIFO and internal memory order.
- `Makefile` — build both demos quickly on Linux/macOS/WSL or MinGW.

How to use
1. Open the folder in your editor (VS Code recommended).

2. Build:
   - Using Make (Linux/macOS/WSL, or MinGW with make):
     ```
     make
     ```
     This builds two executables: `sorting_demo` and `ds_visualizer`.

   - Or compile individually:
     ```
     g++ -std=c++17 -O2 sorting_demo.cpp -o sorting_demo
     g++ -std=c++17 -O2 ds_visualizer.cpp -o ds_visualizer
     ```

   - On Windows with MSVC you may need to replace `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` and use proper includes, or use MinGW/g++ which supports the examples as-is.

3. Run:
   - Sorting demo:
     ```
     ./sorting_demo
     ```
     Choose option 1 for step-by-step on small arrays (n ≤ 20) or option 2 to compare all algorithms.

   - Stack & Queue visualizer:
     ```
     ./ds_visualizer
     ```
     Use menus to push/pop/enqueue/dequeue and use auto-demo sequences for quick presentation.

Zipping the folder
- To make a zip for submission or transfer (Linux/macOS/WSL):
  ```
  zip -r DSA-Demos.zip .
  ```
- On Windows: right-click the folder → Send to → Compressed (zipped) folder.

Presentation tips (5–8 minutes)
- Sorting demo:
  - Show Bubble Sort step-mode for a small array (n ≤ 10) and explain swaps/comparisons.
  - Use "compare all" on a larger array to show time & counts difference (Bubble/Selection/Insertion ≈ O(n^2) vs QuickSort ≈ O(n log n) average).
  - Show the small code snippet for swap/comparison and mention Big-O.

- Stack & Queue:
  - Demonstrate push 1,2,3 and pop/dequeue to highlight LIFO vs FIFO.
  - Show array queue head/tail indices and resizing to explain circular buffer and amortized O(1).
  - For linked list, explain pointers/front-rear and memory allocation.

If you want I can:
- Create a single combined `main.cpp` that includes both demos behind one menu (so you compile just one program),
- Replace `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` with explicit includes for MSVC compatibility,
- Generate a small 3–4 slide PPTX text (title + demo steps + key points) you can paste into PowerPoint.
